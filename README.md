# Alexandre Legault

I study the social and political dimensions of climate adaptation in rural communities. I specifically seek to understand how Nova Scotia's municipalities seek, identify, and use information in policy development and implementation. I previously studied how people relate to the Bay of Fundy’s dykeland system in the context of managed retreat. As Rochelle Owen Consulting's Research Associate, I am actively involved in a range of practitioner-led climate adaptation projects.
